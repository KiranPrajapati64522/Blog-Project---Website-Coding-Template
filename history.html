            reprogrammed by rearranging the strings to make the puppets do different things. It can be said that the machine was
            programmed to make the puppets do certain things and also had scope for reprogramming.</p>

        <h2>History Of Coding</h2>

        <p class="txt-justify">The story of coding begins in the 19th century with the works of a certain Ada Lovelace. Ada, 
            born on December 10, 1815, was an English mathematician and writer. She is also commonly referred to as the world’s 
            first computer programmer. Her works, however, were inspired by Charles Babbage’s invention, The Analytical Engine.</p>

        <p class="txt-justify">Ada first met Charles Babbage at the age of 17, when he had just invented the analytical engine. However, 
            giant strides into the world of programming were made when she came across an article on analytical computers by the
            Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea. Ada dug deeper into his work and published her own paper in 1843. She indicated 
            that when the machine is fed a sequence of operations, with the help of signs and numbers, it could be competently used 
            to solve various mathematical problems. This can be recognized as the foundation of programming.</p>
        
        <p class="txt-justify">In the 1920s, Germans began to communicate using secret coded messages with the help of their famous 
            machine, The Enigma. The British were eager to break through these codes and interpret the messages, and Turing was hired 
            for the job. Turing’s machine was able to break through the constantly altering code and, thus, ease the manual effort and 
            time consumption of code-breaking. From this point, Turing developed a more flexible, advanced machine known as the 
            “Advanced Computing Engine.” It was named “advanced” because it took “abbreviated computer instructions” to perform 
            its functions. This was arguably the first computer language used and was the focal point at the beginning of the
            modern programming world.</p>

        <h2>Development of Programming Languages</h2>

        <img  src="C:\Users\kiran\Kiran Prajapti vs\webdevelopment\languageimage.jpg" width="1450" height="650">

        <p class="txt-justify">The first proposal for a fully developed programming language was PlankalkÜl, formulated by 
            Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. However, this language was never implemented. The earliest significant contributions
             with regard to programming languages were made in the 1950s when numerous languages were developed.</p>

        <p class="txt-justify">In 1954, FORTRAN was developed by a team at IBM led by John Backus. It was the first highly developed
             language that was fully implemented, rather than just having a theoretical design. It is still a widely used language in 
             the development of high-performance computers and is generally a common feature of the world’s fastest supercomputers. </p>

        <p class="txt-justify">Another significantly important language developed during this period was ALGOL. It is said to be the 
            mother language of many modern-day languages, including C++, Python, and JavaScript, to name a few. </p>

        <p class="txt-justify">From the perspective of coding, the 1980s are considered the golden age of development. In 1983, we 
            witnessed the conception of C++, a language used even today in various tools like Google Chrome, Adobe, etc. In 1987, 
            we saw the development and launch of PERL, a language used by Amazon and IMDB, amongst others.</p>

        <p class="txt-justify">In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee brought forward a very important invention for today’s generation, the 
            internet. Along with the internet, he also introduced the world to HTML, URL, and HTTP ⏤ the backbone of novel technological 
            development. This trend of inventions and advancements in coding continued in the 1990s, which saw the introduction of 
            Python, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. These developments were necessary because they have been used to develop social media,
             Android applications, and various streaming services widely popular around the world.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p class="txt-justify">Throughout the course of your journey, you will be able to see the history of coding from its inception
            in the 1840s to its current state from a broad perspective and how it has evolved into a stronghold for ushering the world
            into a more technically and technologically promising future. Automation, machine learning, and AI are paving the way for
            a new chapter in the coding journey, and if its history is anything to go by, the future holds even more exciting and 
            enthralling stuff to grasp.</p>
